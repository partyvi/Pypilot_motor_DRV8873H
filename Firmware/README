This motor controller monitor receives commands over a serial port.


It monitors voltage, current, temperature and fault pins, and
outputs PWM to command an ESC.

The ESC may need to be reprogrammed to have forward and reverse,
and brushed or brushless.


Based on arduino nano.  The efuse byte should be set to enable the
brown-out detector (BOD) not always enabled by default.  This is critical
to ensure flash pages are not corrupted.   Also, often nano clones
don't set the lock bits correctly.  If the BAD_FUSES flag is reported it
the fuses should be programmed correctly

To enable, with one arduino programmed with arduinoisp

Read:
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -u -p m328p -U efuse:r:-:h

Write:
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -u -p m328p -U efuse:w:0x4:m
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -u -p m328p -U lock:w:0xcf:m


NOTE:  Sometimes this fails with avrdude: stk500_disable(): unknown response=0x12
despite correct connections. a simple workaround is to use 38400 baud rate one time:
avrdude -c avrisp -b 38400 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -u -p m328p -U efuse:r:-:h
resuling in: avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 1 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00 etc..
yes, it fails, then try again with the correct baud rate this somehow fixes it


If the ESC has the bootloader loaded:
   The ESC can be programmed over the 1 wire interface.
   The arduino script ArduinoUSBLinker must be loaded to the arduino.
   The ESC can be programmed from the makefile commands in the brushed_tgy repository.
   Once the ESC is programmed, the arduino can be reprogrammed back to motor.ino

Without bootloader (requires soldering, or special tool)
   arduinoisp script loaded to additional arduino.
   The ESC can install the bootloader this way.
   This arduino must be connected to the esc:
   SCK MISO MOSI 5v GND - connected between both arduinos
   RESET (esc) <-> D10 (arduino) connected
